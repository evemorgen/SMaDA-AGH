# Modelling of Physical Systems

This course is dedicated to do some awesome things related to simulation of (surprise, surprise) physical systems.  
  
All things are done within the [taurus.fis.agh.edu.pl](ssh://taurus.fis.agh.edu.pl) server.  
Logins are based on student surname prefixed with _v_ for some reason.  
Main tool used during classes is MATLAB (ugh)
